While early studies on Hotel Operations productivity efficiency have centred largely on revenue performance or cost related indices using Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), recent studies have also included hotel specific factors like location, style of management and even macro-economic factors that can impact overall efficiency of a hotel (Barros, 2005)."

Overall, our insights and recommendations aim to improve hotel’s business efficiency. To develop prototype of our dashboard, we used external dataset to model the visualization. We expect that our project’s end-product of giving a holistic view of data will benefit hotel business management."
